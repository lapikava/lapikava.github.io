								<h1>Photo editor app</h1>
								<p>The application started out as app developer's graphics coding practice. After some time he compiled a library of photo filters and decided he doesn't want the library just sitting on his hard drive. He then approached me with the idea and after first brief discussion we decided to collaborate to produce an application for Android.</p>

                <p>Before starting we needed to come up with the strategy and requirements. To help with that we conducted a competitor analysis and ran a small Typeform survey. As a result we were able to narrow down the main points we should be focusing on:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Application stability and performance</li>
									<li>File quality after editing process &mdash; we are not cropping images and allowing to save files at original resolution (up to 4096px)</li>
									<li>Clean and user-friendly user interface &mdash; many users are confused by too many options, complicated onboarding or apps looking like a pro tool</li>
									<li>Give the users feeling of being in control &mdash; while we decided to keep the app simple and filter-focused we are still adding essential edit options</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>To solve the posed problems we obviously needed a system in place. In 2019-2020 IG was also running a global rebranding so it's been decided to develop an email design system as part of that project. From the point of view of technology our CRM team has been working with Salesforce Marketing Cloud for some time so it's been naturally chosen to implement the design system. Design system guided by clear standards is a way to improve consistency. And reusable components and templates built in Salesforce content builder could make the email development truly user-friendly and scalable.</p>

										</div>
									</div>

								<p>As for the user interface the main idea was to keep it simple yet let it have some personality. So I've picked a dark theme colour palette with one accent colour assuring it passes the color contrast check for the labels. Also I've designed a small set of icons to ensure the iconography is consistent and fit the overall design.</p>
