								<h1>Email Design System</h1>
								<h2>Problem</h2>
								<p>IG is a global leader in online trading and investments serving both retail and institutional markets with nearly 240000 clients worldwide. Email marketing is an essential part of the company strategy with dozens of emails sent every day both to existing client and prospects. Being a multinational company with 17 operationals across 5 continents the email demand and production is decentralized.</p>

											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/emails-old.gif" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>
								<p>Pain points:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>design inconsistency â€” a lot of people working without one point of reference, agencies get involved, legacy emails which haven't been updated in years</li>
									<li>technically complicated email production which let to a lot of errors and broken templates</li>
									<li>me being the sole designer who works on emails building and fixing errors / broken templates was a bottle-neck in the process</li>
									<li>all those things combined resulted in high costs of emails produced</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>To solve the posed problems we obviously needed a system in place. In 2019-2020 IG was also running a global rebranding so it's been decided to develop an email design system as part of that project. From the point of view of technology our CRM team has been working with Salesforce Marketing Cloud for some time so it's been naturally chosen to implement the design system. Design system guided by clear standards is a way to improve consistency. And reusable components and templates built in Salesforce content builder could make the email development truly user-friendly and scalable.</p>
							


							<h2>Process</h2>

								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/emails-audit.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<br>
										<p>First and one of the most important steps was preparation. Together with Comms and CRM teams we ran an audit of existing emails to collect the main common design patterns used and identify current state of things. In parallel, we were running meetings with the stakeholders, local offices and localization team to discuss the results of an audit and collect the requirements. Separately we've had discussions with CRM team regarding Salesforce content builder to make sure we keep our expectations in check with technical possibilities. In about a month we've had enough essential information to outline the draft plan.</p>

							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<br>
										<p>By the time the plan was ready IG global redesign was at the stage where the main rules and guides were in place. Using them as a base I've started working on the email design system. Having a proper plan outlined during our preparatory phase allowed me to focus on the things that were required at this moment so can't stress enough the importance of that first preparatory phase. Based of specific email requirements I've prepared the style guide and mocked up the main components according to the components list. With base taking shape I proceeded to mock up the templates to test out if things fit properly and current state/problems to solve.</p>

								</div>

							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/emails-version.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<br>
										<p>Another important part was running the mockups and test templates through stakeholders to be sure we are on the same page in terms of requirements. And as the main brand design system was being developed and evolving in parallel we had to make sure to run review sessions with other teams, with Head of Design and Head of Brand. That helped to make sure everything email related develops consistently with our other parts of the brand and allowed to resolve the issues and compromises we had due to technical constrain.</p>

							<div class="box alt">
								<div class="row gtr-uniform">
									<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
										<br>
										<p>The final step was bringing the system to live. Obviously with the amount of emails running the migration had to be divided in phases. The first phase was connected to the global brand launch so had a very tight deadline. Considering that it mainly consisted of working with the agency to produce temporal transitional HTML templates. In parallel, we started building the templates and components in Salesforce content builder. At the moment we have a solid base of reusable components and image library integrated so majority of local marketing has transferred to using Salesforce builder.</p>

								</div>
							</div>



							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>The migration process is still in progress with plans to finish in 2021. But even at the moment we see the process has improved greatly: marketing teams can build emails easier and faster meaning they can focus more on user journeys and testings. They also started running campaigns they would previously have to reject due to lack of resource. New system also allows more time for reviews and feedback.</p>

								</div>
							</div>
							<p style="padding-bottom:60px;">All that while keeping the designs consistent which should lead to better brand visibility and recognition. Also, a well set-up system allows for a pain-free adjustments and changes for example for a separate market needs.</p>
