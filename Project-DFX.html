								<h1 style="color:#ec9651;">DailyFX website</h1>
								<p>In 2016 IG acquired DailyFX - portal for forex trading news, charts, indicators and analysis. Since then, we were bringing DailyFX more in line with IG brand in several stages. I got to work on different parts on the process over the years.</p>

								<p>During one of the first stages our business goal was to increase client engagement for internal DailyFX resources as well as converting them into IG clients. One of the approaches we decided on was to use banner across the website but they had to be less ad-like and more part of the website. I was designing and then building in HTML/CSS animated responsive banners for DailyFX trading guides and IG Academy promotion basing each one on corresponding styles.</p>

                <p>Another project I was working on was setting up a basic infographics library. DailyFX is a content heavy website with articles being published several times a day. Hence, infographics are an essential part of the content strategy and SEO optimization. I've set up the main approach with templates for the most frequently used infographics types basing it of IG infographics style guides to bring the content of two websites closer visually.</p>

										<div class="row aln-center gtr-uniform">
											<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/infographics.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										</div>
									</div>

								<p>In 2019 DailyFX was going through the complete redesign. As part of the team I was involved in redesigning webpages based on the freshly established design system. The main challenge was to make sure with redesign we don't brake users expectations and patterns on the website. So we were heavily relying on the user data gathered over the years. As a result we were able to increase user engagement and satisfaction looking at our metrics since the new design launch.</p>
