								<h2>Problem</h2>
								<p>A big international multi industry corporation realised the need for a proper internal tool track production emissions. As the need arised from the new regultaions they also saw it as a possible business opportunity and decided to have a POC to pitch the tool to the clients to see whether it would be a good portfolio piece for them. </p>

								<h2>Solution</h2>
								<p>As a team of three in a tight 6-weeks timeline we created dummy website covering the base functionality of a tool plus a number of mockups showcasing additional possible features. We focused on the ease of use as we pinpoited that the main challenge with the tool would be it's occasional use by different people so everything should be clear for any first-time user.</p>
                				<!-- <p>I worked as designer for the project together with a manager and a product owner. As we had a tight deadline our main priority was to properly come up with the list of features we realistically could include as well as decide on how we are going to make it. With a help from a different team we were given an internal domain and a component library with which we would built our POC. So after initial wireframes were getting approved with the stakeholders I'd build them as an actual webpage we could share with the client. Not only that allowed us to reduce time translating designs to code but also improved the feedback loop as we did have a significant time difference with our client. Though we had to use dummy data for presentation and static images for charts as their library didn't include any the client had a great success with the pitch and decided to go through with a full project for the tool thanks to our POC.</p> -->

								<h2>Results</h2>
								<p>The tool was not only green lighted internally but also received genuine interest from the clients so there is an ongoing work on a production-level version of the tool.</p>

								<h2>Learnings</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>Project success was the result of efficient communication within a lean team and a proper preparation phase;</li>
									<li>Strict deadline with the feature list catered to what's possible within that timeframe helped keep work and discussions with the stakeholders focused and productive;</li>
