								<h1 style="color:#375ea2;">POC for emission tracking service</h1>
								<p>A big international multi industry corporation realised the need for a proper internal tool track production emissions. At the same time they saw the need for such a tool across their client base so they decided to have a POC to pitch the tool to the clients and see whether or not it would be a good portfolio piece for them. </p>

                <p>I worked as designer for the project together with a manager and a product owner. As we had a tight deadline our main priority was to properly come up with the list of features we realistically could include as well as decide on how we are going to make it. With a help from a different team we were given an internal domain and a component library with which we would built our POC. So after initial wireframes were getting approved with the stakeholders I'd build them as an actual webpage we could share with the client. Not only that allowed us to reduce time translating designs to code but also improved the feedback loop as we did have a significant time difference with our client. Though we had to use dummy data for presentation and static images for charts as their library didn't include any the client had a great success with the pitch and decided to go through with a full project for the tool thanks to our POC.</p>
